# Changelog

## 2.1.16-r4

🔍 Smarter Meta-Module Detection
Previously the installer only recognized three hardcoded meta-modules by name. Any fork, rename, or custom implementation would cause an unnecessary abort. The detection is now capability-based — the installer probes for actual mount capability using marker files, capability flags, and a live bind-mount test. Works with magic_mount_rs, hybrid_mount, meta-overlayfs, and any future or custom implementation that exposes real mount capability.
🛡️ Blocklist Action — OISD Big List Integration
Added an Action button in the module manager. Tap it to download and merge the latest OISD Big List — one of the most comprehensive and well-maintained blocklists available, covering ads, trackers, malware, and phishing domains. The updater merges new entries with your existing blocklist, removes duplicates, and hot-reloads dnscrypt-proxy without a reboot. Safe to run multiple times — never downgrades your existing list.

## 2.1.16-r3

### ✨ New Features

- **Help documentation** — added `help.html` to webroot with 20 sections:
  full explanation of how the module works, all config options with examples,
  blocklist usage (incl. new CIDR support), IP encryption (ipcrypt algorithms),
  resolver details, VPN combination guide, FAQ, and What's New in v2.1.16
- **HELP button** — added to the dashboard header row alongside DNS Test,
  Ads Test, Ads Test 2, My IP — opens help.html directly from the monitor

v2.1.16-r2

- Fix: query.log and webroot/query.log are now cleared on every
  process (re)start — dashboard no longer shows stale data from
  previous sessions

## 2.1.16-r1 — 2026-05-25

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed dashboard stats freezing** — previously after the query log reached its limit the dashboard would stop updating and show stale cumulative data regardless of restarts or reflashes
- **Fixed "5000 cap" display issue** — total query count was always showing exactly 5000 when the log was full, making it impossible to tell real traffic from a truncated view

### ✨ New Features

- **2-hour rolling window** — the dashboard now shows only the last 2 hours of DNS traffic in real time; old entries automatically drop off, stats always reflect what's happening now
- **awk-based timestamp filtering** — `webroot/query.log` is built by filtering `query.log` by real timestamp every 10 seconds, not by line count; if `awk` is unavailable on the device a safe `tail` fallback is used automatically

### ⚙️ Changes

- `query.log` rotation threshold raised from **2MB → 10MB** (keeps last 30,000 lines as full history buffer on storage)
- `webroot/query.log` no longer uses a fixed `tail -n 5000`; replaced by `build_rolling_window()` which extracts the last 2 hours dynamically
- Dashboard banner now shows `Live — N entries · last 2h`
- Overview section shows `Window: rolling 2h` so the user always knows what time range is displayed
- Footer updated to `2h window · auto-refresh 10s`

### 📋 Technical Details

- `service.sh` — replaced `rotate_query_log` threshold and added `build_rolling_window()` function with awk + fallback logic
- `index.html` — updated `loadData()`, `renderStats()`, `buildCards()` and footer strings to reflect rolling window context

## [2.1.16] - 2026-05-24

### 🔄 DNSCrypt-Proxy upstream (2.1.16)
- Servers with temporarily high RTT now recover automatically and re-enter rotation — previously they could stay penalized forever
- Servers are no longer penalized for slow responses when the reply is served from stale cache — fairer load balancing with `wp2`
- `blocked-ips.txt` now officially supports full CIDR notation (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`) in addition to prefix wildcards
- Dashboard HTML pages are no longer cached — fixes stale UI after upgrades
- `jsdelivr` added as additional mirror for resolver lists — more reliable startup fetching
- HTTP/3 probing now uses a negative cache to avoid repeated probes against servers known not to support it
- HTTP transport handles `Alt-Svc: clear` correctly and reuses connections more aggressively
- Log entries now include the relay name when a query was sent through an anonymized DNS or ODoH relay
- ODoH: 401 key-refresh path hardened against panics and races
- `tls_cipher_suite` option is now a no-op — modern TLS stacks no longer expose cipher suite selection; option removed from config
- New `tls_prefer_rsa` option available for systems without hardware AES (not needed on ARM64 with hardware AES)
- `miekg/dns` library updated to v2 series
- `-resolve` command now correctly reports incomplete DNSSEC support instead of treating partial signatures as success

### 🛠️ Module changes
- Updated binary to dnscrypt-proxy `2.1.16` arm64
- Removed `tls_cipher_suite = [52392]` from `dnscrypt-proxy.toml` — option is now a no-op upstream
- Fixed QUIC iptables rule in `post-fs-data.sh` — `--reject-with` flag was missing from `-D` causing the old rule to not be properly cleaned up on reload
- Fixed watchdog loop in `service.sh` to check `:5354` port instead of process name — consistent with startup `READY` check and more reliable
- Fixed status check in `service.sh` to use `:5354` port — avoids false positives if a process named `dnscrypt-proxy` exists but is not listening
- Updated `blocked-ips.txt` with additional rebind protection ranges: link-local (`169.254.*`), full CGNAT range (`100.64-127.*`), documentation ranges (`192.0.2.*`, `198.51.100.*`, `203.0.113.*`), reserved ranges (`240-255.*`), and full IPv6 rebind protection (`::1`, `::`, `fc*`, `fd*`, `fe80*`, `2001:db8*`, `fec-fef*`)

## Version v2.1.15-r4

### Updated
- Updated dnscrypt-proxy to latest upstream build

### Fixed
- Added upstream fix for malformed DNS responses
- Improved validation of DNS reply question sections
- Better handling of invalid/malformed DNS packets
- Increased stability and parser safety in response pipeline

### Security
- Hardened DNS response validation against malformed packets

## v2.1.15-r3 — 2026-05-23

### 🖥️ Webroot UI — full redesign *(new)*

- `index.html` replaces the built-in dnscrypt-proxy dashboard at `127.0.0.1:5555`
- Scrollable dashboard with 6 sections: Overview, Result Distribution, Resolvers, Query Types, Top Domains, Recent Queries
- Live status banner with pulsing dot indicator
- Built-in music player with visualizer bars, volume control and session restore across navigation
- Quick-access buttons: DNS Test, Ads Test, Ads Test 2, My IP
- Query log trimmed to 2000 lines for webroot copy — reduced I/O with no meaningful data loss
- Original dnscrypt-proxy UI remains accessible directly at `http://127.0.0.1:5555`

## v2.1.15-r2 (2026-05-21)

### Binary update
- Upstream dnscrypt-proxy `4f151a5` — **xtransport: improve HTTP connection reuse**
  - `MaxIdleConns` raised from 1 → 16: multi-resolver setups no longer re-handshake on every server rotation
  - `IdleConnTimeout` decoupled from keepalive knob and fixed at 90 seconds — connections stay warm regardless of keepalive config
  - HTTP/3 (QUIC) transport now correctly drains idle connections on rebuild, same as HTTP/2
  - SNI fix for DoH stamps that connect via IP with a different cert name — TLS/QUIC no longer overrides SNI incorrectly

### Module fix
- `service.sh` — `lift_dns_block()` now uses `iptables -C` before `-D`; rules are only removed when they actually exist. Eliminates silent no-op iptables calls on every 10-second watchdog tick when the boot block is already gone.

---

## v2.1.15-r1 — 2026-05-21

Script-only revision. No binary update.

### 🔒 QUIC Block *(new)*
Added iptables rule to block UDP port 443 (QUIC protocol) in `post-fs-data.sh`.
Chrome, YouTube and other Google apps use QUIC with built-in DoH that can bypass
dnscrypt-proxy DNS policies. Browsers auto-fallback to TLS/TCP transparently with
no user impact. Rule uses `-C` check to prevent duplicates on reload.
Cleanly removed on uninstall via `uninstall.sh`.

### 🔁 Watchdog — Port-Based Process Detection *(fix)*
Replaced unreliable `pgrep -x dnscrypt-proxy` with `ss` port check in `service.sh`.
`pgrep -x` in root shell context was matching the watchdog script itself,
causing a spurious restart loop and `FATAL: bind: address already in use`
errors in the log every 10 seconds.

### 🛡️ Watchdog — Duplicate iptables Prevention *(fix)*
All `iptables -A` rules in `post-fs-data.sh` now use `-C || -A` pattern.
Rules are only added if they don't already exist, preventing duplicates
on module reload or kernel network events.

### 📊 Status — Accurate Health Check *(fix)*
Removed `nslookup` upstream check. `nslookup` is a Termux binary not available
in `/system/bin/`, causing status to always show `DNS Upstream Fail` even when
everything was working. Status now uses reliable `ss` port check.

### ✍️ Status — Reduced Filesystem Writes *(fix)*
`module.prop` is now only rewritten when status actually changes.
Previously `sed -i` ran every 10 seconds regardless, causing unnecessary
writes to the `/data` partition.

### ⚡ Watchdog — CPU Priority *(new)*
Added `renice -n 10` at startup of `service.sh`. The watchdog now runs
at low CPU priority and does not compete with foreground apps.

### 🔍 SELinux Logging *(new)*
Added SELinux detection at watchdog startup. If SELinux is Enforcing,
an INFO entry is written to the log to aid debugging on custom ROMs.

### 🔧 ss Fallback to netstat *(new)*
Added automatic fallback: if `ss` is not available on the ROM,
the watchdog transparently uses `netstat` instead. Improves compatibility
with stripped-down or older Android builds.

### 🛠️ Installer — Safe getevent Cleanup *(fix)*
Replaced `pkill -f "getevent"` with `pkill -P $$` in `customize.sh`.
The old command could accidentally kill unrelated getevent processes
(e.g. an active Termux session). Now only child processes of the
installer itself are terminated.

## v2.1.15 — 2026-05-18

### 🔍 Conflict Detection & Auto-Removal *(new)*
Installer automatically detects conflicting DNS modules and apps before
installation. User is prompted via volume keys to remove them safely.

### ✅ Meta-Module Verification *(new)*
Installation aborts with clear instructions if no compatible meta-module
is detected.

### 🔒 Boot-Time DNS Leak Prevention *(new)*
DNS is blocked at boot via iptables until dnscrypt-proxy is confirmed
listening on port 5354. The startup leak window is now closed.

### 📵 Full IPv6 Kill *(new)*
IPv6 disabled at three levels simultaneously — Android system properties,
kernel sysctl and ip6tables DROP policy. Re-enforced every 60 seconds
by the watchdog to survive network events.

### 🔁 Self-Healing Watchdog *(new)*
Watchdog monitors the proxy and restarts it if it dies. Uses `ss` with
`netstat` fallback for port detection. 30-second startup timeout with
full logging.

### 🛡️ Hardened Resolver List *(new)*
Three no-log, DNSSEC-validating resolvers across three jurisdictions:
Cloudflare (DoH), Quad9 nofilter (DNSCrypt), Mullvad Base (DoH).
Fastest one is selected automatically.

### ⚡ DNSCrypt-Proxy 2.1.15 *(upstream)*
- Dynamic timeout reduction under high load
- More accurate cache statistics
- Enhanced monitoring UI
- Fixed IPv6 DoH stamp double-bracketing bug
- Proxy hostname pre-resolution via bootstrap resolvers
